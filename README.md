# VisualSPHysics
VisualSPHysics is an add-on for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) that allows the user to render realistic images and animations for [DualSPHysics](http://dual.sphysics.org/) simulations.

VisualSPHysics also includes a foam simulator for DualSPHysics fluid simulations. It is based on the method of [M. Ihmsen et al.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-012-0697-9)

More details about this tool can be read on the conference paper [Advanced fluid visualisation with DualSPHysics and Blender
](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321420314_Advanced_fluid_visualisation_with_DualSPHysics_and_Blender).
